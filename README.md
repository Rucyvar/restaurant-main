#### As part of our final project, we created a restaurant website using HTML5, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Our goal was to design an appealing and user-friendly interface showcasing the restaurantâ€™s menu, location, and ambiance. We used HTML5 for content structure, Bootstrap for a responsive layout, and JavaScript for interactivity, such as an online reservation system. We were pleased with the result and received positive feedback from our teachers and peers.
